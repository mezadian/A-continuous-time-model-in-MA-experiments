All data are stored in csv format.  Note that there are no new original data associated with this study; these data are provided for convenience but can all be reproduced exactly using the simulation code and mathematical techniques described in the manuscript.
For reference, all filenames give the appropriate figure number and panel from the manuscript.

Columns in each file as described below.  For each data column, we provide the following in order:

Variable name, Type of computation, Type of distribution, number of generations, Mathematical symbol, Units, Allowable values (any relevant parameter values that distinguish that column, in parentheses)
In any field, "--" indicates not applicable.
